mockserver v.0.0.0
==================


**Deprecated**
Please use [Mockaccino](https://github.com/yahoo/mockaccino), it's more mature, more configurable, just better.
This is a far ancestor of it. 

==
A simple Node (and Express.js) server to quickly mock web services responses.

It's configurable to work stand-alone or to be installed in your own Express app under a route. 

Everything you need to know is in server.js
